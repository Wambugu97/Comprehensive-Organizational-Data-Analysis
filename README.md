  - projects.csv: Lists all projects, including their unique identifiers, names, descriptions, start dates, and planned end dates.

  - completed_projects.csv: Specific details on projects that have been successfully finished, potentially including actual completion dates and outcomes.

  - upcoming_projects.csv: Information regarding projects that are planned for the future, including their proposed timelines and objectives.

  - project_assignments.csv: A crucial linking table detailing which employees are assigned to which projects, including their roles and assignment durations.
